- hi there! I’m @cherriisxda, I also use the nicknames "Ceecee" or "bones".
- you probably found this from Ponytown! It's my current fixation, I love it
- I can usually be seen playing as Carrot Top (golden harvest), or "beyond her garden" (reference, hehe).
- it's best to reach me through my discord, @bone.yard

- I have other interests as well! Pokemon, MLP, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, and much more!
